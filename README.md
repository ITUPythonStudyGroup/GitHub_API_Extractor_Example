## GitHub API data extractor 
Use this code to access the GitHub APIs to get data about GitHub repositories and users.

Code written by Bence Kollanyi @kollanyi 

## Before you run the code
Please add your own Token to the code files before you run them. The easiest way to get a personal access token is to go to the following URL and create a token: 
https://github.com/settings/tokens/new 

The token authenticate you when you use the API. Without authentication your search is limited by a strict API limit. 

## Environment 
I wrote the code in Python 3.5.1. Use Python 3+ or edit the code to run it in older Python versions. 

## Akcnoledgments 
Thanks @bearfrieze and @JoshuaKoh for making my code less messy and easier to read. :)
